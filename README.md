a personal informational page. welcome to the code! it's a mess, i know.

## sitemap
`/index.html` - landing page, fancy animations, etc

`/info/index.html` - bulk of the page, where the main "window" is located

`/exit/index.html` - ending page/idle animation

`/styles` - my css that dictates animations + styles

`/scripts` - javscript that creates dynamic pages

## code browsing
unsure where to start? try starting at `/index.html` on the left-side panel! it has comments for basic html structure as well as my personal code conventions.
